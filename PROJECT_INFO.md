# Project Information

## Project Name
AcousticShield

## Elevator Pitch
AcousticShield revolutionizes vehicle safety through AI-powered acoustic analysis. Our system listens to vehicle sounds in real-time and instantly identifies critical driving events—collision warnings, emergency braking, and tire skidding—that traditional sensors might miss.

Built on AWS SageMaker with HuggingFace's wav2vec2 transformer model, we've created an end-to-end ML pipeline that synthesizes training data, fine-tunes deep learning models, and deploys scalable inference endpoints. The system processes 1000+ audio samples across multiple risk scenarios, achieving production-ready classification in under 500ms per prediction.

What makes AcousticShield unique is its ability to understand acoustic context that visual sensors can't capture—the subtle differences between normal tire friction and dangerous skidding, or the acoustic signature of an imminent collision. This provides an additional layer of safety intelligence for autonomous vehicles, fleet management systems, and driver assistance technologies.

From data pipeline to deployment, we've built a complete MLOps solution showcasing modern cloud architecture, audio signal processing, and transformer-based deep learning—all optimized for real-time vehicle safety applications.

## Description
AcousticShield uses deep learning to analyze vehicle sounds and classify critical driving situations like collision warnings, emergency braking, and tire skidding. Built with AWS SageMaker and HuggingFace Transformers, it provides real-time acoustic intelligence for vehicle safety monitoring.
